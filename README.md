# Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth
Rewriting code for "Deep Networks with Stochastic Depth" http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09382 in keras.

Original code is at https://github.com/yueatsprograms/Stochastic_Depth.

I make use of keras's new API in this code, which is at `keras-1` branch. 

This code is still in WIP. (I cannot build this network with my GeForce GTX970.)
